# SagaSynth Project Overview

## 1. What it does

SagaSynth is a decentralized web platform (dApp) built to address the shortage of data in the healthcare field by allowing users to create high-quality synthetic medical datasets using artificial intelligence (AI).

Key features include:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Users can use a 5-step wizard to create new medical datasets. This process includes selecting a source dataset, configuring AI parameters, defining a prompt to guide the model, and then generating data.
- **Dataset Marketplace**: Generated datasets can be listed on a decentralized marketplace. Each dataset is represented by an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), enabling transparent buying, selling, ownership, and provenance verification.
- **Research Bounty Program**: The platform allows administrators to create "bounties" to incentivize the community to research and analyze datasets. Researchers can contribute and receive rewards.

## 2. Problem & Solution

### Problem:

- **Medical Data Shortage**: Medical data is very difficult to collect due to strict privacy regulations (such as HIPAA, GDPR), high costs, and ethical issues.
- **Privacy Risks**: Using real patient data for research and AI development always poses risks of sensitive information leakage.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Real-world medical datasets are often imbalanced, lacking rare cases, making it difficult to train effective AI models.
- **Lack of Incentives for Data Sharing**: Researchers and healthcare organizations lack a safe and beneficial mechanism to share their data.

### Solution:

- **Safe Synthetic Data Generation**: SagaSynth uses advanced AI models (like Gemini, Llama) to create synthetic data with statistical characteristics similar to real data but without any personally identifiable information, ensuring privacy safety.
- **Data Tokenization as NFTs**: By turning each dataset into an NFT, SagaSynth creates a mechanism for provenance verification, ownership proof, and facilitates a transparent and efficient data marketplace.
- **Research Incentivization through Bounties**: The bounty system creates economic incentives for the community to participate in analyzing and improving dataset quality, promoting AI development in healthcare.
- **Decentralization and Transparency**: Using blockchain (through smart contracts) ensures that all transactions, ownership, and data history are recorded publicly and immutably.

## 3. Communities

This project aims to build and serve the following communities:

- **AI Researchers and Data Scientists**: Providing an abundant, safe, and diverse data source for training and testing AI models without privacy barriers.
- **Healthcare Organizations and Hospitals**: Allowing them to share statistical characteristics of their data without revealing patient information, while monetizing their data assets.
- **Blockchain and Web3 Developers**: Creating a practical and valuable use case for blockchain and NFT technology in an important field.
- **Students and Learners**: Providing a safe environment to practice and experiment with medical data.

By combining AI, blockchain, and a token-based economic model, SagaSynth not only solves the technical problem of data creation but also builds a sustainable ecosystem to promote innovation in the healthcare field.
